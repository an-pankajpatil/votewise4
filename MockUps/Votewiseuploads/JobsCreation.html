<p><center><b><h2> JOBS CREATION</h2></b></center></p>
<p>How can the government encourage the creation of jobs?</p>
<p>There are a number of common ways that the government tries:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Lower the interest rate on borrowing money.  The Federal Bank can lower the interest rate  on loans they make to banks.  The banks  can then choose to pass on the savings to consumers and businesses who want to  buy a car or expand their business. <br><br>  </li>
  <li>Income Tax break for the rich.  The idea is that people with more capital are  more likely to invest it in a business therefore creating potential job  openings.  But the more common investment  nowadays are real estate and stock market speculation.  These don&rsquo;t create jobs.  So then it comes down to, do the rich buy  more American-made goods than foreign made goods as compared to the  poor/middle class? If not, then this doesn't help the creation of good paying manufactureing jobs, but just poor paying sevice and retail jobs.</li><br><br>
  <li>Income Tax break for the poor/middle class.  The idea is that with more money in their  hands, the poor will buy more goods therefore spurring American industry.  But do the poor/middle class buy more  American-made goods than the wealthy do?    One advantage of a tax break for the poor is that they tend to spend the money while rich people tend to put their money in savings.</li><br><br>
  <li>Tax rebates – there is some evidence to show  that if someone receives a check that they didn&rsquo;t expect, they are more likely to  spend it rather than save it.  (as  compared to a tax reduction which would make their paycheck a few dollars more  a week which might go unnoticed.)  These  purchases would give a quick boost to the economy but might not be long  lasting.</li><br><br>
  <li>Income Tax breaks to all corporations.  Since companies actually hire people, the  thought is that if they have more money, they will hire more people.  But they also have the option of paying their  top employees more or using the money ro open factories overseas.</li><br><br>
</ol>
<p>(As the world changes and we become more international in  our purchases and business dealings, the above incentives have less local  effect than they once did. But there may be many indirect  benefits/downsides.  If you give checks  out, people may get excited and feel good and spend more money than the actual  check.  Or they may feel pessimistic  about their government going further into debt for an ineffective fix and  decide to spend less.  More than just  about anything else, the short-term economy is influenced by public perceptions  of hope and safety.  If the public feels  like there is a rainy day around the corner, they save instead of spending. If  they feel the future is sunny, then they will buy those unnecessary toys they  always wanted.  The techniques above are  the most popular because they can be done right away and require little  thought.  This is good for two  reasons.  If the economic downturn is a  hiccup, then a few dollars in people&rsquo;s pockets can help improve their attitudes  and turn the economy around.  And also  because the effect takes place in the politician&rsquo;s term of office instead of  long-term improvements which might take effect years later after the voters  kicked him out because they saw no evidence of improvement.)</p><br><br>
<ol start=6>
  <li>Aimed Tax breaks or other financial incentives  for individual industries or companies.  Because  the money comes with strings attached and is aimed at local industry, the  benefits are a little more direct.  These  focused incentives could include such things as reducing the taxes for a  particular corporation that is planning on building a factory in your  town.  But there are downsides to  this.<br><br>
Giving breaks to individual companies gives them a financial advantage over other local competitors and could destroy industry already existing in that town.   Taking away those tax benefits some day down the road might cause a  company that was profitable for artificial reasons to go belly up. So governments get trapped into situations  where the local industry is trashed by the favored newcomer, and if they take  away the now hard to afford tax incentives, they will lose the last remaining  jobs. <br><br>
    Another potential problem is the  creation of artificial industries.  Let&rsquo;s  say for example, you think it&rsquo;s in the nation&rsquo;s national security interest that  peaches be grown in America and not imported.   If you were to pay farmers to grow them, you might end up with more than  people could eat.  These would then go on  the market really cheap because supply and  demand.  So seeing this cheap resource,  other farmers feed it to their horses because it&rsquo;s cheaper than hay, but horses  can&rsquo;t properly digest peaches, so they have to feed them pharmaceuticals.  Other chemists devise ways of creating  plastic from the starch because it&rsquo;s now cheaper than oil…. Before you know it,  you have all these companies that are basing their entire incomes off of your  subsidies.  They are all asking for you  to increase the subsidies or their industries will fail.  If you do, then the price goes down again,  and you have more industries cropping up to meet an artificial demand.  If you don&rsquo;t, then all those companies will  fail and all their employees will be unemployed.  In the meantime, you have placed artificial  competition on the companies already in business, possibly destroying  businesses making hay, and other resources.   <br><br>
    Aimed tax breaks can all be done well, but it takes a lot of planning, long term  vision, and constant and repetitive re-evaluation every year to make sure you  are not doing more harm than good.</li><br><br>
  <li>Hiring people for public works -If you are  looking for the best dollar for dollar value for local investment, then hiring  people off of the unemployment rolls to do labor intensive work that benefits  the community might be good.  This way, you  are getting a direct benefit to the community first and then that person can go  and spend money in the community.  It&rsquo;s  like a tax break with free labor attached.   Keep in mind that if these public works are material intensive as  opposed to labor intensive then you don&rsquo;t have as direct a local impact.  For example, with road construction, you  might be using materials derived from oil made overseas.  If the public work creates an obvious  improvement to the rest of the community, then this will have a psychological  affect on consumers.  Their improved hope  in the future will increase their purchases.   If however, the project is unnecessary and the public knows it, then it  may be a waste of money, reduce the public&rsquo;s hope in the future and therefore  sink the economy deeper.   </li><br><br>
  <li>Infrastructure- Building roads, bridges, power lines,  telecommunication and other ways for communities to connect makes it less  expensive and easier for all industries and individuals to conduct  commerce.  If these are planned well,  they can increase safety, invite expansion of business and create other  opportunities.  If planned poorly, they  can be costly and ineffective or at worst encourage consumers to go elsewhere,  killing local business. Another downside is that, while patching roads and  applying paint to bridges can be done at a moment&rsquo;s notice, building a bridge  from scratch could take years of planning by a few engineers before a large  number of construction workers can be put to work.  So it doesn&rsquo;t work as a quick fix.  By then, the economy could have rebounded on  its own.</li><br><br>
  <li>Research grants – since the 80&rsquo;s, companies have  had to fend off hostile take overs by appearing more immediately profitable  (thus making their stocks too expensive for easy flipping.)  In order to do this, they have massively reduced  reinvestment in their research and development departments.  Many companies only research things that they  believe will have a good chance of a quick payoff.  This means that the long-term research,  higher risk, or lower profit margin projects are not studied.  This has slowly eroded our technology  advantage over other nations.  So, paying  for research could bring back that advantage.   The disadvantages include: the research being non-fruitful, other  companies artificially altering to fit the research grant instead of market demands,  and competing with projects already being researched by private industry.  Many other foreign governments spend massive  amounts of money on research, but also are part owners of the companies that  benefit from this research.  This is a  socialistic approach and is not as popular in America&rsquo;s capitalist society.</li>
  <br><br>
  <li>Buying  products that require research – The billions of dollars that go into advanced  weapon systems, for example, also sponsors research whose innovations can be  used in other industries.  Boeing makes  fighter aircraft, but the knowledge they gain in building those can be used towards  their commercial fleet (which they manufacture here and ship worldwide.)  This is the more common way for the US  government to sponsor research.</li><br><br>
  <li>Education  grants – an educated public can better compete in the global economy.  But should these grants be focused on  specific industries?  If we were to focus  on giving education grants/scholarships to engineering students versus history  students, for example, that might put us in a better place for manufacturing.  However, there are a good number of years between  creating grants and kids graduating and being in a position to make an  impact.  In the meantime, the nation&rsquo;s  needs may have changed.  For example,  there was recently a rush to make more nurse practitioners, but there were more  made than the economy could support.  So  any decisions to support education should be made very carefully with long tern  goals in mind.  Projects that cost a lot  up front and don&rsquo;t see a payoff for a long time are not popular with  politicians because they cannot easily prove to voters that they did a good  thing.</li>
  <br><br>
  <li>Public  transportation – proper public transportation can increase the functionality of  a town by connecting workers/consumers and businesses.  Poorly planned public transportation is a  waste of money.</li><br><br>
  <li>Job  training – training the unemployed/underemployed in skills that are highly  needed could have a great payoff in re-employment.  But this could also create trained people in  a skill that is no longer needed, drive wages down for skilled jobs because the  skill is no longer hard to find, and could compete with local trade schools.</li><br><br>
  <li>Health  and human services.  If you pay for basic  things like mending a broken leg, stitches, or daycare, you can get people back  to the workforce faster and they will be more productive when compared to  someone who never went to the doctor and now has a limp or other reduced  capacity for the rest of their lives.   The biggest downside is the grey areas.   Giving a 25 year old an arm cast so they can be more productive over  their lifetime is obviously worth it, but where do you draw the line?  What if a minimum wage earner needs a high  cost kidney replacement one year before retirement?  A purely economic program can turn into a  messy moral debate.  </li><br><br>
  <li>Advertising  campaign – the most important thing for the economy in the short term is the  public perception.  If people feel safe,  they will spend.  If they fear the  future, they will save their money.  Of  course, if the public knows that there is nothing behind your advertising  campaign other than smoke and mirrors, it will do no good and could cause  people to become even more hopeless.</li><br><br>
