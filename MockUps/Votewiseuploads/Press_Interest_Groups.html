Press and Interest Groups play a key part in informing the voters and the politicians about the issues &#8211 locally and across the country. In the current launch, we teach the users about the issues by asking the users questions that inform them while poling them at the same time.  We have over a thousand questions written, but there is a very good chance that we missed many things that are vital to your interests.  We invite you to review our questions and suggest more. </p>


<p>In future launches, we will be posting essays from Interest Groups and the Press.  Users of all kinds will be able to comment on the quality of the information, how useful the essay is, and how pro or con the essay is about the issue. </p>


<p>A user forum will also be added that will (among other things) allow Press to rate the performance of local officials based on the promises they made.  And special interest groups will be able to form chat groups and organize people on a local level.  Press will also be able to ask politicians questions in online debates.</p>
 
<p>There are many other functions on the way.  It is a great way to engage your audience.  If you would like to see our current set of questions, submit questions of your own, or essays to be posted in the next launch, please don&#8217t hesitate to contact us at the appropriate email below. </p>
