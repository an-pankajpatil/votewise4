<p><h1>Where to Vote</h1></p>
<h2>Registering to Vote</h2>
Before you can vote, you have to make sure to register.  Different states have different rules about what paperwork you need, and how long before the election you need to send that paperwork in to vote.  Your best bet is contacting your county board of elections.

<p>Becasue you live in Lehigh County, PA, yours is<a href="https://www.lehighcounty.org/Departments/Voter-Registration">HERE</a></p>

<p><h2>Absentee Ballots</h2>
</p>You should know that it is possible to mail in your ballot if you are physically unable to go to the voting booth.  You can find out more about that at your County Board of Elections <a href="https://www.lehighcounty.org/Departments/Voter-Registration">HERE</a><br>
If you are overseas or in the military, you can get help from a federally run website <a href="http://www.fvap.gov/">HERE</a>
<p><h2>Where is the voting booth?</h2>
</p>Below we've listed a few sites run by other organizations that you can check out to see where to vote and other useful information.
<p>
<a href="http://www.vote411.org/enter-your-address#.Vlo0WnarSM9">Vote411</a>is a website run by The League of Women Voters aimed at helping you find out how to register and vote.</p>
<p>Some states have a site for this purpose. Your state site is <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.state.pa.us/Pages/PollingPlaceInfo.aspx">HERE</a></p>
<p><h2>Who are my Congressmen?</h2>
</p>Below are a list of other useful websites that can help you find out about your Federal representatives.
<p><a href="http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/">THIS</a> is a link to a website run by the Federal Government to find out who represents you in the House of Representatives.  Every state is gets a number of Representatives in Congress based on the population of that state.  Each of those representatives represent just a small geopgraphical part of that state.  You need to enter your address to find out which representative represents your district.</p>
<a href="http://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/">THIS</a> is a link to a website run by the Federal Government which provides contact information for your Senators. (Every State is represented by two Senators.  Both of these Senators represent you.  So if you want to write to your Senator in hopes that they will vote in one way or another on a particular bill, you should write both of them. )
<p><h2>Tracking Legislation</h2>
</p>Below are some websites that track Federal legislation and Congressional voting records.
<p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/">GOVTRACK</a> is a civic minded business that tracks legislation and voting records.</p>
<a href="http://www.senate.gov/reference/common/faq/how_to_votes.htm">THIS</a> is a page run by the Federal Government that allows you to see the voting records in Congress.  It is accurate, but lacks analysis, so you will have to read the bills in order to understand what they were voting for.
<p><a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/">THIS</a> is a page run by the Washington Post.  This includes voting records with some analysis and different ways of organizing data.</p>
