Fact Checking

<h2><b>Sites</b></h2>
<p>For very popular stuff - national news and national hoaxes, there are a few sites that check the facts for you.  Two of the most useful ones are:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.politifact.com/">Politifact</a> looks at statement made by national politicians and rates their level of truth.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.snopes.com/">Snopes</a> Looks at a wide variety of rumors, wives tales, and fake news stories.</p>
<h2><b>Doing Your Own Research</b></h2>
</p>When you are doing your own research, the first step is to think about your sources. Read our essay about judging sources <a target="_blank" href="WhereToGetNews.html">HERE</a>.

A good place to start is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>.  Wikipedia is a non-profit that uses concerned citizens like yourself to write essays.  They are then judged by the readers.  Generally speaking, people who know about the subject will write about things they care about and others in that field will correct them.  But on occassion, people who group together can subvert the truth and create false information on there.   But these attacks tend not to last long, so if you see something that seems bizarre, it's probably a data attack.  Check other sources and check Wikipedia again in a couple weeks.<br><br>

Once you have some basic information, then you can do further research.  Wikipedia forces essay writers to site their sources, so you can go straight to their sources if you want.  Or you can use key phrases to do searches elsewhere.<br><br>

If you use the search engine in your web browser, you should start off with using just one or two key words.  This might show you more results than you could possibly want, but by looking over these results briefly, you can see who else is talking about this issue, if similar things happened elsewhere and a lot of other surprizing things.<br><br>
A second or third sweep using more words or enclosing a phrase in quotes will refine your search to just a few results.<br><br>
For example, let's say that you hear that innoculating your child causes autism.  Perhaps you read an article that quoted Andrew Wakefield's study linking Autism and inoculation.  If you typed in the words &quot;Autism &quot; and &quot;inoculation &quot;, you would see a lot of different links.  Some scientific papers proving that his study was a fraud and some people saying that they still have fear.  But if you put in a quote from his paper, you would likely just get his paper and not know that his paper was a fraud or any of the controversy that it spawned. <br><br>
Never trust just one source.  Find other sources. If those other sources sound just like the first source, then they probably are just repeating what you heard from the first source. If they use the same exact phrases, be VERY wary.  They may be intentionally repeating talking points that are phrased in a way that someone said were effective at convincing you of something they want you to think.  This is likely propoganda and not true.<br><br>

<b><h2>BEWARE THE BIG LIE</h2></b>
There is a very common tactic used in politics, advertising and other arease called, &quot;the Big Lie&quot;.  There are two concepts involved with this.<br>
<li> &quot;If you tell a lie often enough, it becomes the truth.&quot;  The idea behind this is that if you hear something again and again and again from many sources, you can'thelp but think there must be some truth in it.</li>
<li>If you tell an incredibly huge lie, people will believe that you are telling a partial truth.  We all expect people to fib just a bit.  But we don't expect someone to be outlandish.  So if someone walks into your hospital room carrying a chart and says that he's the world's greatest brain surgeon, you will probably imagine that he's probably just the best one at the hospital or maybe among the top ten.  But you wouldn't imagine that he's just a janitor. </li><p>
Both of these techniques are incredibly common and you should beware of them.
