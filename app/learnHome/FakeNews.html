    Fake News
</center></h1>
</p>
<p>Finding reliable sources for news can be difficult. One thing making it much harder is organizations intentionally putting out fake news. Some of these are satire and are actually  funny. Others, it seems, are either luring audiences in to watch advertising, or are intentionally feeding them misinformation for unknown reasons. Many claim to be satire in the fine print, but that appears to be just so they can avoid being sued.<br><br>

There are some organizations that seem to intentionally  choose names aimed at confusing you into thinking they are a reputable  site. For example, they might call themselves NBC.co.com which makes them look like the major network NBC.com<br>
