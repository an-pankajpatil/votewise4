<center><h1>Political Dictionary</h1></center>

<center><h2>Political Tactics</h2></center>
<p> Below are some techniques that politicians use to confuse you.</p>
<h2>It&#8217s all in the name</h2>
<p>One common practice is to give a bill a great sounding name when it really has nothing to do with it.  If you name something, &quot;The I love America Bill&quot; then it makes anyone who votes against it seem evil.  In the meantime, the bill might promote sending jobs overseas, clear&ndash;cutting forests, or anything else.</p>

<h2>Focus on positive image and vague answers</h2>
<p>If you like someone you just met, you will assume that they feel the same way you do about most things until they prove otherwise. Many politicians capitalize on this by spending tons of money creating a likeable character but avoid saying what they want to do. If they can be vague enough, then voters will fill in the gap with whatever answers they like most. &quot;I want to make America safe&quot; &ndash; could mean &quot;I want to increase spending on food inspection to make sure that poisonous stuff doesn't make it to our dinner table&quot; or it could mean &quot;I want to create a dialogue between police and citizens so that police are more effective in the community&quot; or it could mean &quot;I want to nuke all the other nations, so we are the last one standing and no longer have fear of invasion or economic competition.&quot; Don't trust someone who doesn't give you the details.</p>


<h2><b>Fear</b></h2>
<p>This is currently one of the most popular tactics. Fear creates a &ldquo;fight or flight&rdquo; panic response in  people. This focus on survival eliminates thinking things through and can lead to herd behavior. When you see a crowd running past you  screaming in fear, you don&rsquo;t stop to ask questions, you run too. There have been many cases where crowds of people died in night club fires because everyone was pushing on the exit door instead of stopping to read the sign that says &quot;pull.&quot; Similarly, politicians can try to create this base level of thinking and  herd behavior by creating fear in the voter. They say that you will become the victim of a  great calamity if you don&rsquo;t do what they say. In the face of such fear, many don&rsquo;t question as deeply as they  should. This is a very good way of  getting people to do something short term, but keeping people in a state of  fear for long periods of time has many negative side effects. A caged animal that would normally run, will  eventually turn and fight. Hard. Sometimes this turning is on each other in  the form of physical violence and other crime. Selfishness. Other times it can  destroy hope and the economy. Lesser  lash&ndash;backs would be finding some small fault in the politician and using that  as an excuse to get REALLY angry at him/her A historic example of this  technique is Joe McCarthy and his search for communists For the past 20 years, this tactic has been used a lot by politicians and the media and is probably contributing to  the rise in mass shootings and other extremist activities.</p>
<h2><b>Hope</b></h2>
<p>This one is rarely used. It is the opposite of fear…. to some degree. For the most part, it calms people down,  makes them feel good and enables them take the time to think straight and look  at the ideas a little closer. The public  response is usually not as strong as from fear, but this technique is better  for keeping people motivated for much longer periods of time (there is no  cornered animal response.) But in order  for it to work, you have to have a sense of progress to keep people motivated. There was recently a national politician who  ran on the platform of hope. When he got  into office, he had some minor successes but failed to advertise them as  victories on the path to the big dream. So everyone lost faith in him. Once faith is lost, it&rsquo;s really hard to recover. Creating fear, on the otherhand is really easy. Encouraging hope as a campaign tactic also has  positive side effects on the economy, how people treat each other in the  street, and general happiness. Historic examples of this  technique include Martin Luther King Jr, and Mahatma Ghandi. Ronald Reagan made good use of both fear and  hope techniques at the same time.</p>
<h2><b>Polarizing</b>/Demonizing</h2>
<p>When running for office, it's important to show how you differ from other candidates, so voters can make informed decisions on how to vote, but many candidates try to make it seem like their opponent is Satan. Polarizing people is one of the worst things you can do when trying to solve a problem.  If all of our problems were obvious black and white, then they would be easily solved and we wouldn&#8217t need politicians. But the reality is no one side is ever fully right or wrong. They share comon ground with you and their desires are legitimate from their point of view.  In order to solve problems, you have to treat all the opposing sides as intelligent people who want to do what is best.  If you start off by calling them evil, then everything they have to say is not worth listening to and no solutions can be made. Politicians need to listen to the logic, weigh all the options and compromise to get things done. It's like when you go to the movies with your family. One person wants to see a bloody horror film, another wants to see a romantic comedy. You could spend the evening yelling at each other and never see anything, or you could go together and enjoy an action film where the guy rescues the girl. Polarizing is a good way to win elections, but a horrible way to get anything done once you&#8217re in office.<br>

<h2>Changing the Question</h2>
<p>There is the saying &quot;Don&#8217t answer the question you were asked &ndash; answer the question you WISH you were asked.&quot;  This is the most commonly used tactic.  The other is by answering the question with meaningless phrases (see below) When you hear a politician answer a question, ask yourself, &quot;Did they really say anything?  If so, was it the answer to the question?&quot;</p>

<h2>Commonly used Doublespeak phrases.</h2>
<p>&quot;Doublespeak&quot; is the use of words to say something that appears kind when it is horrific or seem meanigful when it ie entirely meaningless. Here are some examples.</p>
<p><b><u>&quot;Family Values&quot;</u>&ndash; </b>This is a very popular one that really doesn&#8217t mean anything.  What values do a family actually have?  All it takes to make a family is the ability to procreate or adopt.  Even a serial killer can get someone pregnant.   Every family &ndash; including ones you disagree with, have their own sets of values &ndash; different values.  So the phrase &quot;family values&quot; is entirely meaningless.   But when a politician says he supports &quot;family values&quot; it reminds us of our love for our families and associates himself to that love.</p>

<p><b><u>&quot;Special interests/lobbyists&quot;</u> &ndash;</b> Everyone is a special interest, so this too is meaningless.  Everyone has things we care about &ndash; that&#8217s why we vote.  Sometimes we donate money to charities who go to politicians and try to convince them not to allow pollution in our drinking water.  Some of us belong to labor unions who send people to congress to convince them to avoid sending our jobs overseas.  That&#8217s part of representational democracy.  We work fulltime jobs &ndash; many of us work multiple jobs.  It&#8217s impossible for us to become experts in all the problems that face America.  So we choose politicians who we trust to listen to different arguments and come up with conclusions that we would if we were in his shoes.  Part of that process is listening to all sides .  The people who come to him to try to convince him their way is the right way are called &quot;lobyists&quot;.  But by cloaking people in the words &quot;Special Interest groups&quot; or &quot;lobbyists&quot; politicians can make them out as evil villains.  This makes them easy targets, but no one gets rid of them &ndash; partly because they can&#8217t do their job properly without them.  You can&#8217t make an informed decision without first hearing the arguments.</p>

<p><b><u>&quot;Lower taxes, safer streets, better schools&quot;</u></b> &ndash; Everyone wants these things, so most politicians claim they will deliver.  But safer streets and better schools cost money, and if you lower taxes then you have no money to pay for it.  If they don&#8217t give you very specific details of what services they are going to cut back in order to get the money to pay for these new things, then you shouldn&#8217t believe them.</p>

<p><b><u>&quot;Cut the government waste&quot;</u></b> &ndash; Budgets are pretty tight in government programs.   Everyone wants more money for their favorite project., but politicians are scared to raise taxes to pay for them.  You can believe that if there was money that was universally believed to be wasted, someone would have pounced on it and claimed it for themselves.  On the other hand, there are programs that some don&#8217t feel important.  For example, if you don’t have children or want or like them, then you might consider afterschool sports programs to be a waste of money.  If they say they are going to cut the waste, you should find out exactly what they mean by that.</p>

<p><b><u>&quot;Keep America Free/pure&quot;</u>  &ndash;</b> This makes the politician seem like a hero and therefore their opponent is an evil villain.   It's polarizing. It is also a phrase often used to promote prejudice.</p>
