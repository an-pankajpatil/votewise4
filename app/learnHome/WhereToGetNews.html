<p><h2><b>How to Judge Your Sources of Information</b></h2><br>
<p>Sometimes people get the facts wrong by accident.  There is a lot of bad information out there about every subject known to mankind. With so many people stating things as fact that are just opinion or pure fabrication, it becomes hard to find the truth. But here  is a quick guide to help.<br><br>
When judging a source of information, you have to consider:  <b>Bias, Motivation, Risk of them lying, Closeness to original source, Expertise,</b>  and <b>Experience.</b> I will be using VoteWise here as an example for you to judge.</p>

<p><b><u>Bias</u></b> &mdash; everybody has a set of life experiences  that make them believe some things more strongly than others and feel that some  things are more important than others.  Six people can see the same event and each might tell you a different  thing happened.  One might say, &ldquo;A guy  was trying to hit on girls by showing his puppy dog around when someone&rsquo;s  husband got upset and chased him off.&rdquo;  Another person might say &ldquo;There was a freaky looking dog in the park  today.  It looked like a cross between a  cat and a ferret, but it barked, so I think it was a dog.. or an alien.&rdquo;  Both people are telling what they saw from  their point of view, and may not even notice the other&rsquo;s point of view.  It&rsquo;s important to hear the story from a  number of different sources in order to get closer to the truth that you find  important.</p>

<p>Common news source biases &mdash; Most American  news sources explain things almost entirely from the point of view of Americans  with little interest in understanding the motivations of our allies and  enemies.  Some sources favor the point of  view of Democrats (like MSNBC) and some favor the point of view of Republicans  (like FOX News).</p>
<p>VoteWise&rsquo;s Bias &mdash; we try to be as neutral as possible but it&rsquo;s impossible to include ALL information.  We pick what we feel is relevant.  Our bias is based on several assumptions</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can&rsquo;t come up with great solutions unless  you figure out what everyone REALLY wants.  No one sees themselves as evil. We all see ourselves as doing what is right  most of the time.  So when you look at a  conflict, you have to learn how to see it from each and every side &mdash; even if  that side seems insane from the first glance. If you don&rsquo;t think their ideas are &ldquo;good&rdquo; on some level, then you  haven&rsquo;t really figured them out yet.</li>
  <li>You can&rsquo;t come up with a LASTING solution unless  you understand the cause of the problem.</li>
  <li>People from opposing parties are not your  enemies, but rather your allies in finding a solution that fits more people.</li>
  <li>Long term thinking is critical.</li>
  <li>Democracy cannot exist without freedom of  speech.</li>
  <li>Everyone has at least one brilliant thing to  say, so true wisdom requires a lot of listening.</li>
  <li>It is mature and wise to change your mind when  faced with ideas, information, or situations that change. </li>
  <li>The future lies in the hands of the voters.  They have the power to change the world, if  they learn how to use that power and vote wisely.</li>
  <li>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary  proof.</li>
  <li>You should never trust information coming from  just one source &mdash; even from us.  Maybe  someone made a typo or got hacked or just made a mistake.  People make mistakes.  The more important the information is, the  more sources you should check.</li>
  <li>Just because something was done a million times before doesn&rsquo;t mean it was done right.</li>
</ul>

<u><b>Motivation</b></u> &mdash; Everyone has a motivation for  saying what they are saying.  Are they  saying it to get ratings?  Are they  saying it to piss you off?  Are they  saying it to make themselves look good?   Are they saying it to win you over and get something from you?  Oftentimes, this means that a news channel  will have a brilliant scientist debate with a crackpot and say they are of  equal value just because the conflict makes for more entertaining TV.  Sometimes they will encourage fear because it  makes you tune in later for more information.  ex. &quot;There may be something in your kitchen cabinet that can kill you, Tune in at 11 to find out.&quot; Sometimes they say things to appeal to their advertisers or owners.

<p>VoteWise Motivation &mdash; We believe that an  informed electorate will make the world a better place.  We live here too, so improving the world will improve our lives as well.  We are  non-profit.  We rely upon donations of  people like you.  Hopefully if you think  we are doing a good job, you will donate so we can continue to do this.  But mostly we are looking for the world to be better.</p>

<u><b>Risk of Lying</b></u> &mdash; If a big corporate news outlet  lies, they can be sued for millions of dollars.. Their public reputation is besmirched, viewers/readers stop turning to  them for news resulting in massive loss of business, jobs, etc...  If an anonymous blogger lies, then maybe they  get a few fewer readers or at worst, they spend half an hour creating a new  blog.

<p>VoteWise Risk of Lying&mdash; we spent a few  years putting this thing together.  If we  are seen as untrustworthy, it would take a lot of work to fix.</p>

<u><b>Expertise</b></u> &mdash; When it comes to making pies, who  are you going to trust, a baker or a nuclear physicist?  The physicist may be more intelligent, but  the baker is an expert at making pies.. Go to sources that specialize in the information you want.

<p>VoteWise Expertise &mdash; We are generalists who  specialize on the interrelation of different areas. If you want to know more about economics,  environmentalism or any single thing, there are much better sources. </p>

<p><u><b>Closeness to original source</b></u> &mdash; Once information  is out there, it can be interpreted and repeated again and again. Each time it is repeated, it is &ldquo;summarized&rdquo;  and altered.. What may have started out  as someone saying &ldquo;they were late for work&rdquo; may change down the line to &ldquo;they hated their job so they quit.&rdquo;  Sometimes even a normally reputable source can get information from the middle of the  stream instead of the top of the mountain and make bad information seem  good. If you can, go to the original  source.</p>

<p><u><b>Experience</b></u> &mdash;If a source has been trusted for  decades, then viewers/readers have had time to see if that source is reliable.</p>
<p><b>NEVER TRUST JUST ONE SOURCE</b>&mdash; not even us. Everyone can make a mistake. Everyone can be hacked. And even if people are correctly stating what they think, it's not the whole story. Get the story from another angle to get a better idea of the truth. If you are fighting FOR an issue, listen also to people who are AGAINST that same issue.</p>
