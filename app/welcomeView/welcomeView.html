  Welcome to the first test launch of VoteWise.net.  VoteWise is a non-profit non-partisan website where Voters and Politicians can connect without advertising dollars getting in the way. <div>
  <p> You and your local politicians can take multiple choice questionnaires and get a simple side-by-side comparison.  You can see what they want to do, and maybe more important, you can tell them what they SHOULD do.  It&#8217s fun.  It&#8217s easy.  And it&#8217s absolutely FREE.  Don&#8217t let big corporations and special interest groups buy the election with advertising.  Stop trying to make sense of vague promises.  Connect with your politicians directly and find out what they REALLY want to do if they get into office.
